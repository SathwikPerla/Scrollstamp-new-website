# 📌 ScrollStamp

> Smart bookmarking for the web — Message-based for AI chats, scroll-based for everything else.

ScrollStamp is a browser extension that intelligently adapts its bookmarking behavior based on the website you're visiting. On AI chat platforms, it bookmarks specific assistant messages. On all other websites, it bookmarks your scroll position.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

| Site Type | Mode | What Gets Bookmarked |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| AI Chat Platforms | **Message Mode** | Specific AI assistant responses |
| All Other Websites | **Scroll Mode** | Scroll position (with context preview) |

The extension automatically detects which mode to use — no configuration needed.
